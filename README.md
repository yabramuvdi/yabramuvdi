### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an economist and data scientist with experience using methods from machine learning, natural language processing, and causal inference to contribute to the understanding of problems in a wide variety of fields. I enjoy teaching and building accessible demonstrations of ML and NLP methods for a broad audience. My pinned repositories showcase some of this work :)
